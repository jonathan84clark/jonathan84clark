- ðŸ‘‹ I am Jonathan Clark; a professional software engineer and programming/electronics hobbyist. 
- ðŸ‘€ My primary interest is in embedded systems and firmware. That said, I do a lot of other types of development work including game development and applications to meet my family's needs..

## What types of applications can you expect from me?  
I am heavily focused on game development right now, although most of those applications are NOT open-source.  
I have worked and continue to work in the following languages:  
C, C++, C#, Python and JavaScript.  

## Other Fun Facts  
In addition to game development and programming I enjoy building with electronics. I create my own circuit boards by hand, solder all the components in place, test and program these
boards. 
My favorite project is my intelligent flashlight which is now on it's 12th iteration. 
I'm big into mountain biking. Although I am not as skilled (or brave) as many of my mountain biking friends; I really enjoy riding green and blue level trails. 
I'm also a big DIY guy, if I can do something myself instead of hiring someone then I will absolutely do so.  
I'm a huge Star Wars fan, particularly the EU legends books. I find the new Star Wars movies and even TV shows a little underwhelming.
